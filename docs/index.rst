====================================

THis is an awesome **Django Project Boilerplate**!!

With this code you can start a *complex* Django Project
very quickly, with just a few steps!

Some of the BaxoSite Django Project Boilerplate functionalities are:

- **different virtual environments** for developing, testing and production
- **Internationalization** and **localization** to support different languages
- Project structure
- **HTML5 Boilerplate**
- Template Inheritance
- Functional **tests**
- robots.txt and humans.txt configured

Moreover, you can learn how to create this boilerplate **step by step**
in the |baxosite_tutorial|. There you can learn, step by step, how
BaxoSite has been done, and even do it yourself if you want to!!
